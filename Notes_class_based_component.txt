difference between functional and classbased
in class based there is render() fun in app.js
in functional we have no render() function.

little syntax difference in props, state.

eg:

no need to write let c='john'. can write directly,

c = 'john' must be written before render function.

inside return, hello {this.c}


// when you need to creat a constructor.   this is done for state

normally: 

constructor(){

}
// will give you an error.


do this:
need to call super call constructor.

constructor(){
    super();
    console.log('This is a constructor'); // this will be displayed 3 times since 3 newsitem and was written in newsitem
    // this are your state
    article: this.articles,
    loading: false
}


to get the articles automatically, have to write in News.js
{this.state.articles} these are all the articles 
{this.state.articles.map()} map is a higher order array method and uses arrow function
